# Welcome to the Cocktail API!

In this project, we will be pulling data from a cocktail API and have
the ability to search by ID, name, ingredient and the type of glass. We will also be able to update the instructions for how to make a drink using the PUT method.

## To install:

- React (create-react-app <app name>)
- React router && react router dom (npm install react-router react-router-dom)

## Routes

- Name
- Edit

## Issues

- linking the API to webpage
- using bootstrap
- getting the update to work
