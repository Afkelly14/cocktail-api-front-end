# Welcome to the Cocktail API!

In this project, we will be pulling data from a cocktail API and have
the ability to search by ID, name, ingredient and the type of glass.

## To install:

- React (create-react-app <app name>) 
- React router && react router dom (npm install react-router react-router-dom)
- CSS Model. I am using 'React Bootstrap' (npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap) 

## Routes

- Edit

## Issues

- linking the API to webpage
- using bootstrap
- getting the update to work
